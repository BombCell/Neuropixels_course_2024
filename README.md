# Neuropixels course 2024

This repository contains all resources and assignments for the quality control part of [UCL's 2024 Neuropixels Course](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/neuropixels/training/2024-neuropixels-course). If you run into any issues or have any questions, you can send a message on the #2_2-quality-control channel of the 2024 UCL Neuropixels Cours slack or create a github issue here. 

We will go over a typical worksflow to assess unit quality using bombcell and phy. Happy quality control-ing! 

## Setting up 
We will use a freely available dataset generated by Nick Steinmetz that spans visual cortex, hippocampus, and some parts of thalamus in a mouse. This dataset was recorded on an early version of Neuropixels probes, and spike-sorted using Kilosort2, but all these principles and methods are applicable accross Neuropixels probe types and Kilosort versions. 

### Download data
All the necessary data is located [here](https://rdr.ucl.ac.uk/articles/dataset/Recording_with_a_Neuropixels_probe/25232962/1). You will need to donwload the following files and put them in one same folder : 

- amplitudes.npy
- channel_map.npy
- spike_templates.npy
- spike_times.npy
- template_feature_ind.npy
- templates.npy
- params.py
- pc_feature_ind.npy
- similar_templates.noy
- whitening_mat.npy
- whitening_mat_inv.npy
- channel_positions.npy
- stimInfo.mat
- pc_features.pny
- pc_features_ind.npy
- Hopkins_20160722_g0_t0.imec.ap.meta
- rawDataSample.bin
  
Make you sure you *do not* have the following files:     
- ~~cluster_groups.csv~~
- ~~spike_clusters.npy~~

### General inspection
- Using UpSet plots, Hg, Wvf. check performing well. 
- Using the GUI. check performing well. 
- Using Phy
### Refine a threshold
- Use Phy to set qMetric.spatialDecay. Find in docs.
### Refinbe: splitting and merging
